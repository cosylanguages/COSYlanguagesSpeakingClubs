                <h3><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250813083616.htm" target="_blank">Unprecedented Climate Shocks Are Changing the Great Lakes Forever</a></h3>
                <p>Extreme heat waves and cold spells on the Great Lakes have more than doubled since the late 1990s, coinciding with a major El Niño event. Using advanced ocean-style modeling adapted for the lakes, researchers traced temperature trends back to 1940.</p>


            <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Unprecedented:</strong> Never done or known before.</li>

                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> The weather conditions prevailing in an area in general or over a long period.</li>

                <li><strong>Shocks:</strong> Sudden, unexpected, and usually unpleasant events or experiences.</li>

                <li><strong>Coinciding:</strong> Occurring at or during the same time.</li>

                <li><strong>Modeling:</strong> The use of mathematical models to simulate real-life situations.</li>

                <li><strong>Extreme:</strong> Reaching a high or the highest degree; very great.</li>

                <li><strong>Spells:</strong> A short period of a particular type of weather.</li>

                <li><strong>Trends:</strong> A general direction in which something is developing or changing.</li>

                <li><strong>Adapted:</strong> Made suitable for a new use or purpose; modified.</li>

                <li><strong>Traced:</strong> Found or discovered by investigation.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Round One: Yes/No Questions</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Have extreme weather events on the Great Lakes decreased?</li>

                <li>Did the study use old methods for modeling?</li>

                <li>Is this study about the oceans?</li>

                <li>Did the researchers look at temperature trends from the last 10 years only?</li>

                <li>Was the El Niño event a minor factor?</li>

                <li>Is the article about the effects of pollution?</li>

                <li>Is the term &#39;unprecedented&#39; used to mean &#39;common&#39;?</li>

                <li>Are the Great Lakes located in Europe?</li>

                <li>Did the study find that the number of extreme weather events has stayed the same?</li>

                <li>Does the summary mention anything about fish?</li>

            </ol>

            <h3>Round Two: Agree/Disagree Statements</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Climate change is not a serious issue for the Great Lakes.</li>

                <li>Computer modeling is a reliable way to study climate trends.</li>

                <li>The El Niño event is the only cause of the changes in the Great Lakes.</li>

                <li>We should not be concerned about these climate shocks.</li>

                <li>This research is important for understanding the future of the Great Lakes.</li>

                <li>The summary provides a complete picture of the research.</li>

                <li>The vocabulary used in the summary is too complex for the general public.</li>

                <li>More research is needed to confirm these findings.</li>

                <li>The government should take action based on this research.</li>

                <li>This kind of research is a waste of money.</li>
